<p>
A JMX Instrumentation module for tracking important events that occur in your 
S3 service. To enable JMX event tracking, set the Java system property 
<tt>com.sun.management.jmxremote</tt> prior to running your application.
</p>
<p>
Instrumentation for S3Service events such as PUT, GET, HEAD, DELETE is enabled 
by default when JMX is turned on. There is also instrumentation available for 
tracking the S3Bucket and S3Object classes, however this is disabled by default. 
To enable this low-level reporting, set one or both of the following system 
properties to true: <tt>jets3t.bucket.mx</tt>, <tt>jets3t.object.mx</tt>.
</p>
<p>
For example, to run a JetS3t application with full JMX instrumentation enabled, 
specify the following Java system property definitions on the application's 
command line: 
<b><tt>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Djets3t.bucket.mx=true -Djets3t.object.mx=true</tt></b>
</p>
